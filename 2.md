# Get Started

## Installation

Learn how to install, set up, and use Cursor with AI features like Chat, Tab, and Composer.

### Installation Steps

1. Visit [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) and click the “Download” button.
2. The installer for your operating system will automatically download.
3. Run the installer and wait for installation to complete.
4. Launch Cursor via the Desktop shortcut or from the Applications menu.

## Setting Up

On your first launch, you’ll be prompted to configure a few settings to ensure you get up and running quickly!

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: If you are coming from a different editor, you can choose the default shortcuts you want to start with, so they are as familiar as possible.
- **Language**: If you want the AI to talk to you in a different language, you can enter the name of the language you want to use. This can be configured further in the Rules for AI.
- **Codebase Indexing**: Cursor indexes your codebase locally to provide better AI suggestions. Learn more in [Codebase Indexing](#).
- **CLI Shortcuts**: You can choose to install `cursor` and `code` commands to launch Cursor from the terminal.

After configuring these settings, you’ll be prompted to import your VS Code settings. If you accept, this will import your extensions, themes, user settings, and keyboard shortcuts into Cursor, so you can get started right away.

Next, you’ll be asked about your data preference. Read more about them on our [privacy page](#).

If you ever need, you can trigger this view by launching Cursor with the terminal like this:

```bash
cursor --user-data-dir=/some/new/path
```

## Logging In

2. Once signed in, you’ll be sent back to Cursor and you’ll be ready to start coding!
